Notes on the Structure of the Moody's PDFs:
-------------------------------------------

The images are stored as stream objects, i.e. a sequence of bytes.
Stream objects may be of unlimited length.
The context in which a stream is referenced determines what the sequence of bytes represent.

A stream shall consist of a dictionary followed by zero or more bytes bracketed between the keywords
"stream" (followed by newline) and "endstream":
dictionary
stream
...Zero or more bytes...
endstream

All streams are indirect objects (see 7.3.10) and the stream dictionary is a direct object
The stream keyword is followed by CARRIAGE RETURN and LINE FEED or just a LINE FEED
The stream dictionary specifies the exact number of bytes of data in the stream
There is an end-of-line marker after the data and before the endstream keyword (not included in steam length)
Most filters are defined so that the data is self-limiting, i.e. they use an encoding scheme in which an
explicit end of data (EOD) marker delimits the extent of the data.

Entries common to all stream dictionaries:
KEY	       | TYPE			| VALUE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Length	       | integer		| (Required) Number of bytes from beginning of line following the keyword stream
	       | 			| to the last byte just before the keyword endstream
Filter	       | name or array		| The name of a filter applied in processing the stream data, or an array of zero,
	       |      	 		| one, or several names. Multiple filters are applied in the order they are specified
DecodeParams   | dictionary or array	| A parameter dictionary or an array of such dictionaries, used by the filters
	       | 	       		| specified in Filter
F	       | file specification	| The file containing the stream data (ignores bytes inbetween keywords)
FFilter	       | name or array		| Filter for stream's external file
FDecodeParams  | dictionary or array	| DecodeParams for stream's external file
DL	       | integer       		| A non-negative integer representing the number of bytes in the decoded (defiltered)
	       | 			| stream. Can be used to determine, for example, whether enough disk space is available
	       | 			| to write a stream to a file
