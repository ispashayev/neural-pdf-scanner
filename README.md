This project deals with optical character recognition of scanned pdf documents
using machine learning algorithms. It's still in its very early stages.

Currently, I have implemented a Softmax classifier and a configurable
multi-layer neural network to classify subsets of a PDF as containing
a Net Income Table, or not containing a Net Income Table. Currently,
I can train the network to properly classify for one company and one
year. The next step is to do this across the time series (1920-1956).
