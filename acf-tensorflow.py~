Purpose:	Load images for ACF Industries 1956 into tensorflow
'''

'''
We need to partition the data into three sets:
1) Training set - this is a set of data
2) Test set
3) Validation set


Every data point will be a tuple of a vector of numbers representing the values of the pixels in an image and a corresponding label.
Thus, for each set we have a tensor of [# Elements in set, # Elements in vector].
'''

'''
Design decisions:
Assemble the multiple images for each pdf into one giant image

Steps:
1) Figure out where the desired company's region of data is
2) Figure out where the income statement is
3) Collect income statement data - ALL AVAILABLE YEARS
4) Figure out where the balance sheet is
5) Collect balance sheet data - ALL AVAILABLE YEARS
